I always wanted a personal space on the internet, and now i have one!

This website is generated using a static file generator called
[Zola](https://getzola.org/)

Apart from some initial confunsion in the project structure, it's very easy to
use.

It even has support for table of contents and multiple translations! I'm yet to
add that though...

This section of the website will be about all my "big" projects, I will use
the blog section for generalized rambling and also some deep dives that won't
become some kind of "project".

Even tough it has a custom domain, this website is actually deployed using github
pages with an action provided by the Zola team: 
[https://github.com/getzola/github-pages](https://github.com/getzola/github-pages)
