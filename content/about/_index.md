Hi there! My name is Lucca, I don't actually live on the second floor. I'm
known online as *ludihan*.

I'm a brazilian developer, I have many interests and I'm always trying to be a
jack of all trades, but as of now most of my experience is in web development,
gamedev and devops.

My code is very inspired by functional programming, but I don't think it's a
silver bullet, I always adapt my style of programming to whichever context I'm
currently in.

Apart from coding, I really like music and videogames.

Here are my links:
